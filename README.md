This project was designed to test our understanding of Boolean Logic and Branching. 

Examples of Boolean Logic would be relational operators such as (altitude > 100). 

An example of Branching in the solution would be the If/else conditions. 

Be adviced, tools such as ChatGPT 5.0 was used to help me understand the initial code meaning and structure, and helped with a proper formatting of the solution given from the clue.

I added the following piece of code to the initial given code:

if (altitude > 100)
    {
        thruster = 0;
    }
    else if (altitude > 0)
    {
        thruster = 1;
    }
    else
    {
        thruster = 0;
    }
